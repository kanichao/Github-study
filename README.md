#### comment to the reading material

The other day, I saw the post that said "Becoming "man" is easy. It is hard but it is only to get fame and much money and to be active in the various field but how can I become "woman" ? For example, Praising the boring things and the boring stories?"

Certainly, I have wanted to be "man", to get wealth and fame while keep doing what I like such as wearing cute clothes and collecting stuffed toy. 

By reading today's reading material, I remenber this, and feel that this is also little proof that women are "opposite" to men.
